    description: "The Voyah Free is the first production model from Voyah, the premium electric vehicle brand of Chinese state-owned Dongfeng Motor Corporation. Introduced in 2021, the Free is a mid-size luxury SUV designed to compete with established premium electric vehicles. The exterior styling was led by Italian design house Italdesign, resulting in a sleek, modern appearance with a distinctive front light bar, floating roof design, and flush door handles. The vehicle is offered in both pure electric (EV) and extended-range electric vehicle (EREV) configurations. The EV version features a dual-motor all-wheel-drive setup producing approximately 488 horsepower (360 kW) with a 106 kWh battery pack providing a NEDC range of up to 500 kilometers (310 miles). The EREV variant combines a smaller battery with a 1.5-liter petrol engine acting as a generator, extending the total range to around 860 kilometers (535 miles). The interior offers a premium experience with high-quality materials, a minimalist design centered around a large central touchscreen and digital instrument cluster, and extensive ambient lighting. Advanced technology features include facial recognition, augmented reality head-up display, and level 2+ driver assistance systems. The Voyah Free represents China's growing ambitions in the premium EV segment, combining luxury appointments and advanced technology with competitive electric performance. Initially launched in China, the Free has subsequently expanded to select international markets including Norway and certain European countries."
